# First settings below are for the cplex solver
# note: we have to use a pretty wide mipgap (0.01=1%) to get solutions in reasonable time
# with discrete unit-commitment (could also specify timelimit=7200 to stop after two hours)

# 'inputs' has 6 days per period and 12 hours per day (12 days in 2045)
# It solves in 15-20 minutes with cplex without discrete unit commitment,
# or about an hour with discrete unit commitment

# inputs_tiny is a mini, fast version of the model

# use the relaxed-split-commit method of RPS allocation (fairly fast and accurate)
